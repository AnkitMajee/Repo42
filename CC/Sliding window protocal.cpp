The provided C++ code simulates the sending of frames over a network using a sliding window protocol. Here's a detailed explanation of the entire code:

### Code Breakdown

#### Header and Namespace
```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
```
- This includes the iostream library, which is necessary for input and output operations (e.g., `cin` and `cout`).
- The `using namespace std;` statement allows the program to use the standard namespace, so we don't need to prefix standard library objects with `std::`.

#### Main Function
```cpp
int main()
{
```
- This is the entry point of the program. The `int` return type indicates that the function will return an integer value to the operating system upon completion.

#### Variable Declarations
```cpp
    int w, i, f, frames[50];
```
- `w` is the window size, which determines how many frames can be sent before waiting for an acknowledgment.
- `i` is a loop counter.
- `f` is the total number of frames to be transmitted.
- `frames[50]` is an array to store the frames. It can hold up to 50 frames.

#### Input Window Size
```cpp
    cout << "Enter Window Size: ";
    cin >> w;
```
- Prompts the user to enter the window size and stores it in the variable `w`.

#### Input Number of Frames
```cpp
    cout << "\nEnter no's of Frame to transmit: \n";
    cin >> f;
```
- Prompts the user to enter the number of frames to transmit and stores it in the variable `f`.

#### Input Frames
```cpp
    cout << "Enter " << f << " frames:\n";
    for (int i = 1; i <= f; i++) {
        cin >> frames[i];
    }
```
- Prompts the user to enter `f` frames and stores them in the `frames` array.
- Uses a for loop to read the frames from the user.

#### Sending Frames
```cpp
    cout << "Sending......Frames......\n";
    cout << "After Sending " << w << " frames at each stage sender waits for acknowledgement sent by the receiver \n";
```
- Prints a message indicating the start of frame transmission.
- Explains that the sender waits for acknowledgment after sending every `w` frames.

#### Frame Transmission with Acknowledgment
```cpp
    for (i = 1; i <= f; i++) {
        if (i % w == 0) {
            cout << frames[i] << "\n";
            cout << "\nAcknowledgement of the above frames sent is received by Sender\n";
        } else {
            cout << frames[i] << " ";
        }
    }
```
- This for loop iterates through all frames.
- If the current frame index `i` is a multiple of the window size `w`, it means the sender has sent `w` frames. Therefore, it prints the frame and then prints an acknowledgment message.
- If the current frame index `i` is not a multiple of `w`, it just prints the frame.

#### Final Acknowledgment
```cpp
    if (f % w != 0) {
        cout << "\nAcknowledgement of the above frames sent is received by sender\n";
    }
```
- After the loop, this condition checks if there are any remaining frames that have not yet received an acknowledgment. If the total number of frames `f` is not a multiple of the window size `w`, it prints the acknowledgment message for the last set of frames.

#### End of Main Function
```cpp
    return 0;
}
```
- Returns 0 to indicate that the program has executed successfully.

### Example Execution
If the user inputs a window size of 3 and frames 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, the output would look like this:
```
Enter Window Size: 3

Enter no's of Frame to transmit: 
6
Enter 6 frames:
1 2 3 4 5 6
Sending......Frames......
After Sending 3 frames at each stage sender waits for acknowledgement sent by the receiver 
1 2 3
Acknowledgement of the above frames sent is received by Sender
4 5 6
Acknowledgement of the above frames sent is received by sender
```
This simulates the sliding window protocol, where the sender transmits a specified number of frames and then waits for acknowledgment before continuing.
